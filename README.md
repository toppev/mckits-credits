## Building
**Note:**
 this does not compile unless you add the plugin in libs/ directory and name it `strikepractice-plugin.jar`. Alternatively, recode/remove the parts that depend on the plugin and use the API instead (see the comments in build.gradle.kts and edit it).
 

Build with `./gradlew build` and you can find the jar in `build/libs/` directory.
